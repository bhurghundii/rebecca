Hybrid Architecture Design for Rebecca + OpenFGA Integration

This shows how to maintain your existing entities in SQLite while using
OpenFGA for relationships and authorization logic.

# ENTITIES THAT STAY IN SQLITE (unchanged)
# =====================================

class UserDAL:
    """Users table stays in SQLite - stores user metadata"""
    # users: id, name, email, created_at, updated_at
    # This is perfect for SQLite - rich metadata, user profiles, etc.
    pass

class UserGroupDAL:
    """User groups table stays in SQLite - stores group metadata"""  
    # user_groups: id, name, description, created_at, updated_at
    # Perfect for SQLite - group information, descriptions, etc.
    pass

class ResourceDAL:
    """Resources table stays in SQLite - stores resource metadata"""
    # resources: id, name, description, type, created_at, updated_at  
    # Perfect for SQLite - file info, metadata, search, etc.
    pass

class ResourceGroupDAL:
    """Resource groups table stays in SQLite - stores group metadata"""
    # resource_groups: id, name, description, created_at, updated_at
    # Perfect for SQLite - organizational structure, etc.
    pass


# RELATIONSHIPS MOVE TO OPENFGA
# ============================

class RelationshipDAL:
    """Relationships now handled by OpenFGA"""
    
    @staticmethod
    def check_relationship(user: str, relation: str, object_ref: str) -> bool:
        """Check permissions using OpenFGA"""
        # This is what we just built!
        pass
    
    @staticmethod  
    def create(user: str, relation: str, object_ref: str):
        """Create relationship in OpenFGA"""
        # Write tuple to OpenFGA
        # Optionally log to SQLite for audit
        pass
    
    @staticmethod
    def add_user_to_group(user_id: str, group_id: str):
        """Add user to group - OpenFGA relationship"""
        # OpenFGA: user:alice member group:admins
        # SQLite: Keep user and group metadata separate
        pass
    
    @staticmethod
    def grant_resource_access(user_id: str, resource_id: str, permission: str):
        """Grant access to resource - OpenFGA relationship"""
        # OpenFGA: user:alice owner doc:report1
        # SQLite: Keep user and resource metadata separate
        pass


# EXAMPLE API ENDPOINT INTEGRATION
# ===============================

def get_user_with_permissions(user_id: str):
    """Example: Get user info + their permissions"""
    
    # Get user metadata from SQLite (fast, rich queries)
    user = UserDAL.get_by_id(user_id)
    
    # Get user's relationships from OpenFGA
    relationships = RelationshipDAL.get_relationships_by_user(f"user:{user_id}")
    
    # Combine for complete picture
    return {
        "user": user,  # From SQLite
        "permissions": relationships  # From OpenFGA
    }

def check_resource_access(user_id: str, resource_id: str, action: str):
    """Example: Check if user can perform action on resource"""
    
    # Fast permission check using OpenFGA
    has_permission = RelationshipDAL.check_relationship(
        f"user:{user_id}", 
        action,  # owner, viewer, editor
        f"doc:{resource_id}"
    )
    
    if has_permission:
        # Get resource details from SQLite
        resource = ResourceDAL.get_by_id(resource_id)
        return resource
    else:
        return None


# MIGRATION STRATEGY
# ==================

def migrate_relationships_to_openfga():
    """Migrate existing relationships from SQLite to OpenFGA"""
    
    # 1. Read all relationships from SQLite
    sqlite_relationships = get_all_sqlite_relationships()
    
    # 2. Transform and write to OpenFGA
    for rel in sqlite_relationships:
        RelationshipDAL.create(
            user=f"user:{rel['user']}",
            relation=rel['relation'], 
            object_ref=f"doc:{rel['object']}"
        )
    
    # 3. Keep SQLite relationships for backup/audit
    # Don't delete immediately - parallel run for safety


# BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH
# =========================

"""
✅ SQLITE STRENGTHS PRESERVED:
- User profiles and metadata
- Complex queries and filtering  
- Rich data types and relationships
- Excellent for CRUD operations
- Great for reporting and analytics

✅ OPENFGA STRENGTHS UTILIZED:
- Fast permission checks
- Scalable authorization logic
- Hierarchical permissions (owner → viewer)
- Group-based permissions  
- Policy-based access control

✅ IMPLEMENTATION BENEFITS:
- Minimal changes to existing code
- Gradual migration possible
- Best performance characteristics
- Maintain data integrity
- Easy rollback if needed
